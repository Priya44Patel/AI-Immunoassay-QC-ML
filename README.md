AI-Driven Immunoassay Quality Control

Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI pipeline for quality control of immunoassay (ELISA-like) data, combining:

Assay data preprocessing
Curve fitting (4PL models)
Quality control metrics
Machine learning classification

Key Features

Automated plate data cleaning
Standard curve fitting & interpolation
QC metrics (CV, outlier detection)
ML model to flag failed samples
Publication-ready visualizations
